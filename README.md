- 🔭 I’m currently building **Vozmia** — an AI-powered multitenancy platform where users create personal agents and flows, like digital concierges for everyday tools.

- 🌱 I’m currently diving into **.NET and Docker** to scale Vozmia’s backend with container isolation and secure multitenant architecture.

- 🧠 I’ve co-founded platforms like **Locay**, which served 40+ restaurants across the Northeastern U.S. with enterprise-grade tools and six-figure annual volume.

- 🧪 My undergrad research at **UMass Boston and MIT** focused on open-source hardware for disease detection—applying engineering to global health problems.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **community-driven tools**—products that help people do more with less tech friction.

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with **Docker security in multitenant SaaS** and container orchestration best practices.

- 💬 Ask me about **Java Script, clean code, or why “agent-based software” is about to change how we interact with the web**.

- 📄 See my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgeagarcia1/)

- ⚡ Fun fact: **I treat debugging like detective work—except the culprit is usually me, three cups of coffee ago.**
